# Account-Information-Tracker
This GUI will allow users to store their account information for various websites and view this information as they please. The information is stored in a JSON file called 'passwords' in the same working directory as the executable.

<h1>How to use</h1>
Download the zip file and extract the contents. The application can be found in dist/PassGui as PassAppGUI.exe. Double click and enjoy saving your account information. The application will create the file 'passwords.json' in the same working directory as the application. If you move the application to another directory, ensure that you move the passwords.json file as well.
